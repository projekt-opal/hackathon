# Data formats

Three data concepts are important: RDF (format), DCAT (vocabulary) and SPARQL (query language).

## RDF (Resource Description Framework)

In the DICE group, we focus on graphs consisting of RDF data. The main concepts are described at [RDF 1.1 Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/).

## DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)

DCAT is an RDF vocabulary which enables to describe datasets and related concepts. It is described at [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/).

## SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)

Like SQL for relational databases, SPARQL can be used to query RDF databases (triplestores). The specification can be found at [SPARQL 1.1 Query Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/).
