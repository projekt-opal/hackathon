### Tasks

In general, we want to use available metadata records or mobility datasets.  
To be more specific and to provide some ideas, we defined some [example tasks](tasks.md).

### Data

Main data formats and specifications are described at page [formats](formats.md).  
Data access information is available at [data](data.md) and [open data paderborn](open-data-paderborn.md).
