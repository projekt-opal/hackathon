# Tasks

In the OPAL project, we're working with DCAT datasets in RDF format (see [data](data.md)).
This is the basis of the hackathon.
There are ideas for components that could be used in the project.

## Data + JavaScript Visualization

Datasets may contain spatial information (geo coordinates).
The spatial information could be visualized as a map like at [OpenDataMonitor](https://opendatamonitor.eu/).
For this you can use a JavaScript library, framework or API. Some examples are listed in this [article](https://geoawesomeness.com/top-19-online-geovisualization-tools-apis-libraries-beautiful-maps/).
